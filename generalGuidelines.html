        The purpose of this app is to allow you to better understand your cognitive abilities and emotional make-up. <br><br>

        We recommend you play the games in a distraction-free environment to get the most accurate results. <br><br>

        As you play games, you will unlock more games. Once you have completed all games, you will receive a trait page. <br><br>

        Each game takes 1-3 minutes and they don't all need to be played in one sitting. <br><br>

        Don't stress: there's no way to do "well" or "poorly" on the games. Just be yourself and we'll help find the best-fit future for you! <br><br>
